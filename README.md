**Chess-1D: Chess in One Dimension ðŸ™ƒ**

This project is a 1D chess game made in Python. I didn't know what to do, so I felt like coding a 1D chess game in just one hour.  

# Piece Movement

- Rook: Moves left and right  
- Knight: Jumps two squares left or right  
- King: Moves one square left or right
